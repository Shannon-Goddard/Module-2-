<br/>
The information displayed is no longer limited to 12 rows with a Static Array<br/>
With a Dynamic Array the rows can adjust as needed, without boundaries
![Input Year](https://github.com/Shannon-Goddard/Module-2-/blob/master/Input%20Year.png)
<br/>
The user is prompted to input a year, in which, to search stock tickers<br/>
The tickers that appear for that year have their volume, starting price, ending price, and return information
<br/>
![Stocks Loaded](https://github.com/Shannon-Goddard/Module-2-/blob/master/Stocks%20Loaded.png)
<br/>
As a bonus feature, because of the "unbound" amount of stocks that can be displayed, the user will have a<br/>
window appear after the year is selected. This window will inform the user how many stocks are listed for that year
